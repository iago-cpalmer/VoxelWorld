# VoxelWorld
Voxel renderer with chunk loading/ unloading system in Unity using C#.
The main goal was to learn the basics of rendering meshes and loading & unloading chunks applying some simple optimizations.
Now, the goal is to expand it a but further to learn more advanced optimizations techniques, procedural generation,
entities... So, in the future it will become a small version of Minecraft.

# Working systems:
- Voxel render.
- Chunk loading & unloading system.
- Save & Load World files (Early version, it works but must be improved and optimized).
- Place and destroy blocks.
- Basic procedural generation.

# Future Features:
- Advanced procedural generation that includes biomes, caves, dungeons & trees generation.
- Entities.
- Transparent blocks.
- Fluids (Water and Lava).
- Inventory.
- Hunger and Health bars.
